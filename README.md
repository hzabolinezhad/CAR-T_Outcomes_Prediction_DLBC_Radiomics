# CAR-T_Outcomes_Prediction_DLBC_Radiomics
 This repository hosts R scripts developed in RStudio (v2023.12.1) for predicting CAR T-cell therapy outcomes in DLBCL patients. By analyzing radiomics features from FDG-PET/CT scans and clinical data from the first month of treatment, the project forecasts treatment response at the third month post-treatment using machine learning techniques.
